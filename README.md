# Wardley Maps Template

I'm just learning my way around this system of mapping. I know there are countless blog posts, websites and tweets from Simon himself on the subject. 

In the spirit of #opensource I thought it would be nice to give back. 

As I'm a huge Noteability user on my iPad I wanted a template that I could install and then be able to map away with my Apple Pencil like the hipster that I am.

It's availble as a PDF file, you could print it out on A4 paper if you wish.
